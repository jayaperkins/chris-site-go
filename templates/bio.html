    <p class="description">
        Christopher Enloe (b. 1997) is an emerging composer and multi-instrumentalist from Hanford, California. He became interested in music theory and improvisation at a young age,
        which led him to pursue composition seriously in his mid-teens. He has been selected as a finalist
        twice in the Ithaca College Choral Composition Competition (2013 and 2016) – one of the youngest
        composers to receive that honor. In 2016, he was awarded the Kol Emet Young Composer’s Prize
        for Jewish Music under adjudication by Dr. Samuel Adler.<br><br> Christopher has studied privately with
        award-winning and published composers Kevin Memley, Dr. Walter Saul, and Grant Fonda.
        He is currently studying at The Masters University in the Los Angeles area, pursuing his
        BM in Music Composition. His ultimate goal is to earn his PhD in composition and form a career
        of writing concert music and teaching at the conservatory or university level.
